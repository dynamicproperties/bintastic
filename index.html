        <strong>How is your service?</strong>
        <p>We only send kind hearted sweethearts who aim to please.</p>
        <strong>How big is the bin?</strong>
        <p>Bins are 40 gallons. They are about 3' long, 2' wide, 18" tall.</p>
        <strong>Are there any restrictions for bins that I provide?</strong>
        <p>Bins that you own and store with us need to be plastic, clean, and under 40 gallons. The lid needs to shut completely.</p>
        <strong>How long is the minimum contract?</strong>
        <p>One month.</p>
        <strong>Do I have to sign a contract?</strong>
        <p>Yes, but the contract is month-to-month. There is no long-term commitment.</p>
        <strong>Delivery/pickup Trip?</strong>
        <p>We'll bring you bins, then pick them up. Each round trip (drop off and pick up) is a "trip." This applies to the first time setup and any time you'd like to access your bins. We can haul about 10 bins at a time, so if you have more, it may require multiple "trips."</p>
        <strong>Can I store anything?</strong>
        <p>You cannot store combustibles like gasoline, ammunition, etc. You can't store anything illegal.</p>
        <strong>What happens when I want to access a bin?</strong>
        <p>Give us a call and tell us the bins you'd like. We'll bring them to you. When you are done, we'll bring them back to storage.</p>
        <strong>What form of payment do you accept?</strong>
        <p>Credit card or debit card are our preferred method of payment. We also accept cash, check, or money order.</p>
        <strong>Is there a security deposit?</strong>
        <p>No.</p>
        <strong>Do you have any deals, promotions, coupons, special pricing for veterans, etc.?</strong>
        <p>No. Our prices are very low, all the time and for everyone.</p>
        <strong>Can I pay in advance?</strong>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <strong>What areas do you service?</strong>
        <p>Our standard "Delivery/pickup Trip" fee covers anywhere in the city of Lubbock. If you are outside of Lubbock, give us call to get delivery pricing. Storage pricing will be the same.</p>
